## Business Logic

### Patient Record Management
- A patient must have a first name and last name to be created.
- If a field is not included in a PUT request, it will not change the original field in the database.
- A Business Associate Agreement (BAA) must be in place before accessing patient data.

### API Key Management
- Each API request must include a Developer API Key and a Customer API Key in the Authorization header.
- Customer API Keys can be enabled or disabled by the customer but cannot change permissions.

### Aging Data Retrieval
- Ensure the Open Dental Service is running before retrieving aging data.
- Check the preference 'Automated Aging Runtime' for a time entry before proceeding.

### API Request Handling
- All API requests require a Content-Type header of 'application/json'.
- Requests must be properly formatted to avoid 400 BadRequest errors.
- API developers with only ApiReadAll permission are throttled to one request per five seconds.

### Data Formatting
- Date fields default to 'yyyy-MM-dd' format.
- DateTime fields default to 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss' format.
- Use DateFormatString and DateTimeFormatString to specify custom formats.

### API Permissions
- All GET methods are throttled at different rates for different users.
- Normal Open Dental permissions are used for logging API actions, but they do not restrict the API from making changes.

### API Modes
- Local API is recommended for applications installed on individual workstations.
- API Service is recommended for applications installed on the database server.
- Remote API is for internet-based applications that need access across multiple practices.

### Cascading Strategy
- Developers should utilize a cascade strategy of API endpoints for redundancy.
- If the API Service is unavailable, applications should fall back to the Remote API.

### Event Subscription Management
- Must specify a valid endpoint URL for event subscriptions.
- Database events will only fire if the workstation is running OpenDental.
- If an event fails to reach the endpoint, the DateTimeStart will not be updated.

### Event Handling
- Database events can contain a maximum of 1000 elements; if exceeded, they will be sent in batches.
- UI events are fired immediately upon user action.
